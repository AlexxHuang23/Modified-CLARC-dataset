# Modified-CLARC-dataset
Here is a modified version of the CLARC dataset on the wastewater system parameters. We assign technical parameters to the arcs in wastewater systems, such as type (wastewater pipe or wastewater pumps) and pipe diameters and shape. 

The original dataset contains only one type of pipe. However, in wastewater simulators, such as SWMM, a certain amount of pipes needs to be assigned as pump pipes. In the real-world, the pump station also doesn't need to pump water to lower altitudes. So, we did this work based on our experience when conducting a simulation of the CLARC wastewater system on SWMM. The parameters haven't been calibrated with real-world flood event data. So, there is still a large room for improvement. We appreciate your suggestion if you also tried to simulate the infrastructure in CLARC dataset. And thank the author of CLARC dataset for providing a valuable dataset for infrastructure simulation.
